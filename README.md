# Description

Simulator of TCP Protocol operation that can be used to solve the third type of exercises of the exams of the course “Computer Networks” at the University of Verona (taught by Prof. Damiano Carra)

### Warning!
This tool has NOT been tested extensively, so it might produce wrong answers. You should only use it for comparison with your own solution.

### Note
As you can see in the picture below, plot quality isn't great, but I realized this after I had already started working with that library and I didn't want to refactor. Anyway, it shouldn't be an issue.

# Install/Usage

Clone this repository or simply download the code. To change the exercise data, simply open the `Main.java` file (it can be found in `it/univr/reti` folder) and update the parameters passed to the `TCPSimulator` object. There are no dependencies to install, just run `Main.java` when you are ready. Output will be displayed both in the console and in graphical form through a plot.
